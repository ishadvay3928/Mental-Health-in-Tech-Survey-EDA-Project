## 📌 Objective

To analyze employee responses on mental health in the workplace to:

* Understand treatment-seeking behavior and mental health interference.
* Explore how company size, benefits, and support systems influence well-being.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

* **Total Records**: Varies based on survey cycle (example: \~1,200 responses).
* **Key Columns**:

  * `Age`, `Gender`, `Country`, `self_employed`, `work_interfere`
  * `family_history`, `treatment`, `benefits`, `care_options`, `wellness_program`
  * `seek_help`, `anonymity`, `leave`, `mental_health_consequence`, etc.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Standardized inconsistent entries (e.g., gender responses).
* Removed unrealistic age values (<18 or >80).
* Converted categorical responses into readable formats and encodings.
* Created derived columns (e.g., age groupings).
* Handled missing values and unified binary responses.

### 💼 Workplace Environment

* **Company Size**:

  * Majority work in **small to mid-sized firms (6–100 employees)**.
  * Indicates scalability challenges for implementing mental health programs.
